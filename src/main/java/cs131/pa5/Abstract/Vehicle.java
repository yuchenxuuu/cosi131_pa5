/**
 * A Vehicle is a Runnable which enters tunnels. You must subclass
 * Vehicle to customize its behavior (e.g., Car, Sled, Ambulance).
 *
 * When you start a thread which runs a Vehicle, the Vehicle will
 * use the given scheduler to try to be admitted in one of the tunnels.
 * The scheduler.admit() will successfully return when a tunnel is found,
 * or it will wait and retry until it eventually admits that vehicle in a tunnel.
 * 
 * Unlike PA3, the vehicle does not know about the available tunnels and 
 * relies on the scheduler to be entered in a tunnel.
 * Thus, the vehicle does not retry to enter a tunnel with busy-waiting like PA3.
 *
 * You will need to edit the run() and doWhileInTunnel() for the 
 * PreemptivePriorityScheduler and allow a vehicle to be signaled 
 * by an Ambulance while running in a tunnel.
